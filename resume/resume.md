## Professional Experience
### Engineer - Computational Physical Sciences
**Applied Research Associates, Inc.**  
Dayton, OH  
10/2023 to 10/2025

- Designed and automated Python- and Bash-based data pipelines to productionize electromagnetic simulation workflows across distributed HPC environments, orchestrating mesh generation (CUBIT) and RF simulation runs across up to 32 nodes on an HPE Cray EX supercomputing cluster — with peak memory utilization of 490 GB per node.
- Parsed and analyzed large simulation output datasets to evaluate RF performance characteristics, visualized scalability metrics using Matplotlib, and reported findings in periodic PowerPoint presentations to inform defense research decisions.
- Supported model validation and comparative analysis across simulation platforms (CREATE-RF SENTRi, Xpatch, FEKO).

### PDM System Administrator / Engineer
**Aerobiotix, LLC**  
Miamisburg, OH  
06/2021 to 08/2023

- Designed and administered a SQL-backed data governance system (PDM vault), establishing data standards, metadata protocols, and 6 automated workflows across 3 departments: Engineering, Quality Assurance, and Operations.
- Developed custom SQL queries and reporting tools to extract and analyze product lifecycle data.
- Automated engineering processes through scripted macros and workflow logic, reducing repetitive manual tasks and improving data integrity.
- Conducted structured root cause analyses using statistical methods and modeling to guide product improvements.
- Collaborated cross-functionally (engineering, quality, manufacturing) to translate operational data into actionable product decisions.

### Senior Engineer - Sales and Design
**Rack Processing Company**  
Moraine, OH  
02/2019 to 06/2021

- Built Python- and Excel-based cost estimation models using multivariate regression to map product feature inputs to pricing outputs, reducing quote turnaround time from \~48 hours to 10 minutes (\~99% reduction).
- Partnered with Sales and Operations to analyze historical product and sales data to improve pricing accuracy and margins.
- Managed $1.5M+ in annual revenue accounts, leveraging data-driven pricing strategies to optimize profitability.

## Projects
### InstaCart Market Basket Analysis
**Penn State - Data Mining - Spring 2026**  
*Tech: Python, SQLite3, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, mlxtend*

Leading a team analysis of 33M+ grocery purchase records across 200K+ users to predict customer reorder behavior. Defined scope, assigned tasks, and coordinated execution across data ingestion, EDA, and association rule mining (Apriori, FP-Growth) phases. Developed a frequency-based one-hot encoding strategy to reduce memory requirements from 480+ GB to under 32 GB across 49K+ unique product IDs, identifying association rules with confidence up to 0.33 and lift up to 3.05. Ongoing: clustering, PCA, and supervised learning for next-basket prediction.

### Ganttoro - Probabilistic Project Scheduling Tool (In Development)
*Tech: Python, PySide6, NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX, Matplotlib, PyQtGraph*

Desktop application that replaces deterministic Gantt charts with Monte Carlo simulation to model real-world schedule uncertainty and optimize project planning decisions. Runs 10K+ vectorized simulations in seconds from user-defined duration distributions (triangular, PERT, normal) and dependency chains, producing P10/P50/P90 completion estimates and box plot timelines.
