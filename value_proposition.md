## I turn complex, messy data into decisions that move the needle -- and I bring 16+ years of engineering discipline to do it right.

Most data professionals can run an analysis. Fewer understand *why* the numbers matter to the business. With a background supporting clients in aerospace / defense (AFRL, NASA, Northrop Grumman), consumer products (Delta Faucet, Costco, Walmart, WestRock), automotive (Rivian, Mercedes-Benz, Tribar Manufacturing), and medical devices, I've spent my career embedded in the problems data is supposed to solve — which means I ask better questions, build more relevant models, and deliver insights that actually get used.

A few things that set me apart:

- **Engineering rigor applied to data.** I hold two US patents, earned a BS in Mechanical Engineering at University of Maryland Baltimore County, and am currently pursuing an MS in Data Analytics at Penn State. 
I don't just fit models -- I understand the systems that generate the data.
- **Proven ROI.** At Rack Processing Company, I built a regression-based cost estimation tool that cut quote turnaround time from 48 hours to 10 minutes — a 99% reduction -- while managing $1.5M+ in annual client revenue.
- **Pipeline to production.** From distributed HPC workflows (Python, Bash, PBS, Slurm) for DoD simulations to SQL-backed PDM systems, I build data infrastructure that runs reliably, not just analyses that run once.
- **Active DoD Secret Clearance.** Available for sensitive or defense-adjacent work without the onboarding delay.

I work best at the intersection of technical depth and business impact -- where getting the analysis right is mission-critical.
