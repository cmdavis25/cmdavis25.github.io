## I turn complex, messy data into decisions that move the needle -- and I bring 16+ years of engineering discipline to do it right.

### Most data professionals can run an analysis...
### But few understand *why* the numbers matter to the business. 

With a background supporting clients in aerospace / defense (AFRL, NASA, Northrop Grumman), consumer products (Delta Faucet, Costco, Walmart, WestRock), automotive (Rivian, Mercedes-Benz, Tribar Manufacturing), and medical devices, I've spent my career embedded in the problems data is supposed to solve.

I ask better questions, build more relevant models, and deliver insights that *actually* get used.

I work best at the intersection of *technical depth* and *business impact* -- 

**where getting the analysis right is mission-critical**.
